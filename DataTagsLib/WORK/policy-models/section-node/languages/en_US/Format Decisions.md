# answers.txt
* Can have line comments (`<--`)
* Empty lines are ignored.
* Now new lines in answers: they should be short!
* spaces/tabs around ":" does not matter, so policy makers can tidy up code as needed (e.g. align colons).

# Space.md
* Can have line comments (`<--`)
* Text is markdown.
* Tag names are either full or non-ambiguous
* Content of text for type goes all the way until next type/EOF
* Type starts by either:
  * New line with type path, ":" (no spaces between line start and ":")
  * New line with "# typePath " EOL.

# node data
* Files are in `nodes/` folder
* Only `.txt` and `.md`/`.mdown` files are considered.
* Internally, files are always considered MarkDown (since text is really a markdown form).
